# GammaKnife
Planning a non-invasive stereotactic radiosurgical treatment of a brain tumour using the Gamma Knife

The Gamma Knife uses Gamma radiation to treat the tumor cells especially in brain. Treats brain
tumors by administering high-intensity gamma radiation therapy in a manner that
concentrates the radiation over a small volume. Uses a hemisphere shaped helmet with
holes drilled in it to direct the radiation to the tumor as pencil beams. All pencil beams
intersect at the same point.

There are 19 MATLAB files. You can run all of these by simply calling the “main” script.
